# R-Project-Who-Is-Drunk-and-When-in-Ames-Iowa

In this project, I grouped, summarized, and visualized data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, home of Iowa State University, from 2013-2017. The data was collected from the State of Iowa. The questions I answered included "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"

This project allowed me to apply skills from several DataCamp courses, including removing NA values by filtering, creating new variables by using the mutate function, carrying out logical operators in R, using the lubridate package for a bit of date-time manipulation, and making boxplots and lineplots using ggplot2.
